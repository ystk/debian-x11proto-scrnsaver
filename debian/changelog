x11proto-scrnsaver (1.1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Not really a new upstream release; working around 1.1.0-1 being a
    native package.
  * Test for obj-$(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE) before creating it during build;
    idempotency fix.
  * Run dh_install w/ --list-missing.
  * Change debhelper build-dep-indep to a normal build-dep, as dh_clean
    is called inside the clean rule.
  * Drop duplicate x11-common dep in -dev package.
  * Bump standards version to 3.7.2.0.
  * Version x11-common pre-dep in -dev package to 1:7.0.0 to match
